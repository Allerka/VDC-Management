Bug Fixes
	- Fixed a bug with the left-side menu highlighting the wrong page while on the dashboard.

Changes
	- Test Registration page core functionality implemented. Page added to top menu links.

|Beta 0.4.1
30 MAR 2021

Bug Fixes

Changes
	- Added "Add Row" functionality to the data admin page.
		* If a row is added while a form field category is selected, the new row will default to that category. Otherwise it will be fully blank, but all fields can be edited in either case.

|Beta 0.4.0
29 MAR 2021

Changes
	- Frontend-based admin interface for editing database entries fully setup and integrated into the app.

Changes
	- Replaced Dashboard page vehicles list tables with react-bootstrap-table2, which allows for column sorting and has built-in search functionality.

|Beta 0.3.5
4 FEB 2021

Bug Fixes
	- Fixed functionality issues with saved drafts. Formulae, dropdowns, etc. are all implemented, with workbook protections retained.

Changes


|Beta 0.3.4
25 JAN 2021

Bug Fixes
	- Celebrated the partial restoration of internet connectivity to the USX233 server (where this app is hosted) by updating a number of packages for both the frontend and backend.
		* This fixes several minor functional issues, closes several security loopholes, should improve efficiency slightly, and means we can keep packages more up-to-date.

Changes
	- Replaced the Excel library used on the backend for saving a draft submission, so that downloaded drafts now include the standard template's formatting.
		* Dropdown selections don't work yet, but general formatting, cell formulae, and even advisory comments are still present.

|Beta 0.3.3
20 JAN 2021

Bug Fixes
	- Fixed several issues with the submission admin page resulting from the API overhaul.
	- Fixed an issue with the API call error handler that would itself cause unhandled errors.

Changes

|Beta 0.3.2
18 JAN 2021

Bug Fixes

Changes
	- Completed the API call class overhaul on the frontend.
	- Adjusted snackbar functionality to deliver messages after a page redirect or reload instead of before (otherwise they would disappear when the page changes after 1-2 seconds).


|Beta 0.3.1
15 JAN 2021

Bug Fixes
	- Fixed a return of the issue where vehicle detail pages would crash instead of loading a placeholder if no data had been downloaded from the server yet (i.e. the first time either page is loaded).

Changes
	- Restructured API calls into a single unified class for more streamlined operation, and to enable full snackbar functionality on all calls, including the ability to receive more detailed error messages from the backend.
	- Purged some more unused template code to improve efficiency.
		* Also altered the build process to ensure the latest version of the code is always used (sometimes some lingering filler code was being left in).


|Beta 0.3.0
14 JAN 2021


Bug Fixes
	- Fixed an issue with the file upload page occasionally crashing instead of displaying an error message if something went wrong.

Changes
	- Added the ability to download a draft spreadsheet to the registration form, which will store any values entered thus far into the spreadsheet, and can then be uploaded as normal.

|Beta 0.2.0
10 DEC 2020

Bug Fixes
	- Assorted formatting fixes

		* Most validation will be conducted on the backend now, and frontend validation will mostly be for requried minimal fields and a few other basic rules (such as positive numbers only).
	- Fixed backend validation to allow blank file uploads (i.e. manual submission with no spreadsheet to attach).

Changes
	- Overhauled manual submission page to bring its formatting in line with the other pages.
		* The entire form is now one page for easier viewing. A jump-to-top button is present in the corner as well.
		* The subheader updates dynamically to reflect what the combined test name would be.
		* Fields, units of measurement, etc. still update based on other selections when appropriate (e.g. country selection for imperial or metric units).

|Beta 0.1.4
16 NOV 2020

Bug Fixes
	- Subheader now properly displays vehicle test ID
	- Reloading the page now actually reloads the page instead of giving load errors on some pages

Changes

		* This includes both updating form fields and adjusting formatting and data management to better match the other (more recent) pages


|Beta 0.1.3
13 NOV 2020

Bug Fixes
	- Partially fixed erroneous subheader titles
		* It displays the correct page title now, but is still having trouble accessing the unique ID for vehicles

Changes
	- Added status management and permission level options to vehicle admin page
		* Changing the status on this page will not send an email to the requester
	- Adjusted session management to be handled entirely by the backend for added security
	- Removed extraneous leftover template code, which should result in slightly faster build and load times
	- Added Changelog page, accessible from the left-side menu


|Beta 0.1.2
11 NOV 2020

Bug Fixes
	- Status management page now correctly reports an error if one occurs during the process.
	- Fixed View/Edit Records pages not always displaying the human-readable label (Again. But for real this time).

Changes
	- Added section for archived vehicles on the submission management page, to help keep the main section at the top focused on current vehicles.
	- Added confirmation popup when attempting to delete a vehicle.


|Beta 0.1.1
9 NOV 2020

Bug Fixes
	- If a user's session has expired, the next time they try to perform any actions, they will be notified as such and redirected to the login screen, instead of nothing happening.
		*  Still working on shifting the expiration check to the backend so that it stays fresh as long as the user is doing anything on the site, rather than being based on when the user logged in from the frontend.

Changes
	- Non-admin users will no longer see the "Edit Records" button on the dashboard page.
	- Additionally, they will receive a notification they lack permissions to edit submissions, or if they attempt to upload a spreadsheet for an existing vehicle.
	- Added a notice about permission level requirements to the Excel upload page.


|Beta 0.1.0
5 NOV 2020

Bug Fixes
	- Cleaning up further data validation errors.
	- Fixed several random fields not displaying the correct values.
	- Fixed selection lists defaulting to the top of the list if the existing value had a space in it.
	- Eliminated a couple typos. Writing degree, activate!
	- Known Issues
		* Status update page always comes back with the success message, even if there was actually an error in the process.
		* Page subheaders are displaying inaccurate info. This was potentially fixed in a recent update by the template devs which hasn't been implemented here yet.
		* Several fields on page four of the registration form are mis-aligned, mucking up the page's formatting.
		* A number of fields on the registration form are now outdated after data structure changes, and thus the submission process will currently fail validation.


Changes
	- Current Features
		* Ability to enter vehicles into the database, whether via a standard web form or by uploading a pre-designed Excel spreadsheet.
		* Can update the vehicle by reuploading the spreadsheet with new values.
		* Dashboard page with basic info on all currently active vehicles
		* Archive section to be added.
		* View full records for individual vehicles.
		* Can edit records for individual vehicles.
		* Will be adjusted so only admins can do so in the future.
		* Submission management page allows for updating a vehicle's status (submitted, pending changes, approved, etc.), and includes automated email functions to notify the submitter.
	- Data restructuring so that data fields drawn from a list of options (such as vehicle type) have those lists populated on the backend for both greater security than the frontend, and to consolidate all data into one place for easier updating.
		* This will also make it possible to develop an interface page allowing for these lists to be updated without having to directly edit the database.
	- First iteration of user permissions.
		* Vehicles will have internal tags for "anyone" and "staff only" access, while stored users will have "staff" and "admin" tags where appropriate. These tags have already been implemented (no way to edit outside of the database yet).
		* On the front page adjustments have been made to take these permission levels into account for displaying vehicles. For example, FEV general users will only be able to see vehicles marked "anyone", VDC staff can also see "staff only" vehicles, and admins can see everything.
	- Adding archive table to front page.
		* The current table is only showing currently active vehicles. This will add archived vehicles for historical reference.
		* The same permission levels as active vehicles will be applied.
	- Assorted bug fixes.
